## Description

This protocol uses a single tip on the p300 multi-channel pipette to distribute custom volumes of buffer (150-300 uL) from a 195 mL reservoir to specified wells of a 96-well destination plate followed by transfer of custom volumes of sample (2-15 uL) from up to three 24-tube racks to specified wells in the destination plate (volumes, rack locations and well locations are specified in a csv file uploaded at the time of protocol download).

## Protocol Steps

Set up: Place up to three 24-tube Opentrons racks in deck slots 1, 4, and 7 and the 96-well destination plate in deck slot 6. Place the reservoir containing diluent in deck slot 5. Opentrons 20 ul tips (deck slot 10). Opentrons 300 ul tips (deck slot 11).

The OT-2 will perform the following steps:
1. Use the p300 multi to distribute buffer from the reservoir to wells of the destination plate according to the uploaded csv file.
2. Use the p20 single to mix the sample source 6x, transfer sample to wells of the destination plate, and mix the destination well 3x according to the uploaded csv file.
