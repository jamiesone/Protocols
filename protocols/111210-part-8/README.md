## Description
This protocol automates the eigth part of a ten part protocol for the [GeneRead QIAact Lung RNA Fusion UMI Panel Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/instruments-and-automation/genereader-system/generead-qiaact-lung-panels-ww/?catno=181936) which constructs molecularly bar-coded DNA libraries for digital sequencing. This protocol automates the Cleanup of Target Enrichment PCR with QIAseq Beads part described in the [GeneRead QIAact Lung RNA Fusion UMI Panel Handbook](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/download.aspx?id=1a71d98a-c45c-44fa-b4af-874cd1d2b61f&lang=en).

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: The total number of DNA samples. Samples must range between 1 (minimum) and 12 (maximum).
* `P300 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.
* `P20 Single GEN2 Pipette Mount Position`: The position of the pipette, either left or right.
* `Magnetic Module Engage Height (mm)`: The height the magnets should raise.

### Reagent Setup

* Thermocycler (Slot 7): PCR Products from PCR Enrichment

* Slot 1: Magnetic Module with NEST 96 Well Deep Well Plate

* Slot 2: 96 Well Aluminum Block with Empty PCR Tubes.

* Slot 3: Temperature Module with 24 Well Aluminum Block. Add QIAact Beads in 1.5 mL tube in position A1.

* Slot 5: NEST 12 Well Reservoir: 80% Ethanol (A1, Blue) and Nuclease-Free Water (A12, Pink)

### Protocol Steps
1. Centrifuge Forward and Reverse PCR products.
2. Combine each forward and reverse PCR product into the magnetic plate.
3. Add 60 uL of Nuclease-free water to make total volume 100 uL.
4. Add 100 uL of QIAact beads to samples on magnetic plate and mix thoroughly.
5. Incubate at Room Temperature for 5 minutes.
6. Engage magnet for 10 minutes to separate beads.
7. Remove supernatant from samples.
8. Completely remove residual supernatant from the samples.
9. Perform an 80% ethanol wash.
10. Repeat previous step.
11. Centrifuge samples and replace on the magnetic module.
12. Engage magnet for 2 minutes.
13. Completely remove residual supernatant from the samples.
14. Air dry beads for 10 minutes.
15. Elute DNA from beads using 16 uL of nuclease-free water.
16. Transfer 13.4 uL of supernatant into fresh PCR tubes in slot 2.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
