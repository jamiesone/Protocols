## Description
This protocol performs the [IDT xGEN MC kit](https://sfvideo.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/protocol/xgen-dna-library-prep-ez-kit-and-xgen-dna-library-prep-ez-uni-kits-protocol.pdf?sfvrsn=57b1e007_8). This protocol uses the stubby adapter (Reagent L3) that is included in the xGEN MC kit during ligation and the barcoding
of samples is performed during PCR by using either xGEN UDIs or CDIs. The alternate protocol version is IDT xGEN MC
UNI that does the barcoding of samples at ligation instead. The Protocol steps and reagents are different between the
two versions. See IDT’s xGEN DNA Library Prep MC Kit protocol for more information about sample barcode kit
requirements.

The script requires manually transferring the sample plate between the Thermocycler and Magnet 3 times. It starts on the
Thermocycler and needs to be moved to the Magnet for the post-ligation cleanup, and then moved to the Thermocycler
for PCR and then back to the Magnet for the post-PCR cleanup.
NOTE: In the script the two positions are handled as magnetic sample plate and thermocycler sample plate; during calibration,
use an empty plate of the same labware as the sample plate on the magnet position to calibrate that position.

Explanation of complex parameters below:
* `Number of Samples`: Samples are prepared as pictured below; with 100ng of input DNA in 50ul of Low EDTA. See IDT’s xGEN DNA Library Prep EZ Kit protocol for more information about sample input requirements.

* `PCR Cycles`: Specify number of PCR cycles if performing PCR on deck.
* `Dry Run`: Yes will return tips, skip incubation times, shorten mix, for testing purposes.
* `Use Modules?`: Yes will not require modules on the deck and will skip module steps, for testing purposes, if `Dry Run` is set to `Yes`, then this variable will automatically set itself to `No`.
* `Reuse Tips?`: No, NYI format for reusing tips
* `Use protocol specific z-offsets?`: Sets whether to use protocol specific z offsets for each tip and labware or no offsets aside from defaults
* `Include End-Repair / A-Tailing Step?`: Specify whether to include this step below. This and all steps below allow you to customize where to start the protocol, run the protocol in parts over multiple days, choose whether to use Opentrons modules or off deck modules, etc.
* `If yes, End-Repair / A-Tailing on deck or off deck?`: Use this step on or off the deck.
* `Include Ligation Step?`: Specify whether to include this step in this run.
* `If yes, ligation Step on or off deck?`: Use this step on or off the deck.
* `Include Post Ligation Step?`: Specify whether to include this step in this run.
* `Include PCR Step?`: Specify whether to include this step in this run.
* `If yes, PCR step on or off deck?`: Use this step on or off the deck.
* `Include First Post PCR Step?`: Specify whether to include this step in this run.
* `Include Second Post PCR Step?`: Specify whether to include this step in this run.
* `P20 Multi-Channel Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to mount the P20 multi-channel pipette.
* `P300 Multi-Channel Mount`: Specify which mount (left or right) to mount the P300 multi-channel pipette.
